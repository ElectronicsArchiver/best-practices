### Visibility

To facilitate reuse of your wonderful work, people should be able to find you and your work. GitHub offers a lot of options to make your research software more visible. 

**Quick start**

- Add a [bio and profile README to your GitHub account][Profile Customization] 
- Add GitHub profile to [your staff page][Staff Page]
- Add [topics] to your repository to increase [findability]. There is also topic for [`#utrecht-university`][Topic University].
